 - Fix flight when switching gamemodes

Event stuff that IDK how to do yet:

Things that might just be impossible:
 - Making some working version of player.stopUsingItem()
 - Reading the player's controls
 - Include Shift Click equipping for scripted item armor
 - Check if texture exists
 - See if we can change how ctrl + backspace works in the code editor

To do before next update:
