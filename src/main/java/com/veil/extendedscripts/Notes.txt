Things I want to add:
 - Fix issues with cones and pyramids in the shape class
 - Improved Overlay class
 - Make the rest of the GUIs (Anvil, Enchantment Table, and Brewing Stand)
 - Make it so that when opening the Furnace time has passed
 - Custom Commands
 - Make it so when you change dimension and login if you were flying beforehand you keep flying
 - Fix flight when switching gamemodes
 - Function to prevent players from moving
 - Add a function for preventing players from using commands
 - Fix setAnimation(7)
 - Add functions related to ids, getting next available ids and check if they're used.
 - Hide the +4 damage on the World Clippers
 - Add attribute style: reversed: +/-<value> <attribute>, units: <attribute> <value> <unit>, change attribute value color
 - Add custom projectile disable damage, hit endermen, can hurt owner, make sure all attributes are saved to nbt
 - Fix shatterParticle not appearing when shattering on mobs
 - Make a command for viewing and managing stored data
 - Add bounciness, multi-jump, reach, and damage reflection
 - Add battle helpers
 - Make it so that scripted items can have custom eating sounds and custom eating particles
 - Barrier blocks
 - Scripted Item Block Placing
 - Add the Extended Scripts API tab to scripting
 - Fix attack event

Lists to add when we see something:
 - Continue searching for more Enums to implement (Nbt data types, npc collision type, overlay component)
 - Expand upon ItemTypes for more types (None for now)

Confusing CustomNPC+ gui stuff:
 - Fix the issue where loaded scripts improperly show ยง
 - See if we can make right-clicking be a previous option button
 - Syntax highlighting for valid event names

Event stuff that IDK how to do yet:
 - Death event that lets you escape death
 - Damage event that lets you take no damage

Things that might just be impossible:
 - Making some working version of player.stopUsingItem()
 - Reading the player's controls
 - Check if texture exists
 - See if we can change how ctrl + backspace works in the code editor
